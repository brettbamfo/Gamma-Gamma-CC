The cc_energy is for Coincidence Counts vs Energy levels, where the spike in energy dictates the energy level that the electron-positron annilation is giving off through Gamma particles
Similarly the cc_timedelay is for Coincidence Counts vs timedelay, where the timedelay is before, left of the graph, or after, right of the graph, with respect to Ch1 as the compared value for Ch0.
So CH1 is either time delayed before or after CH0, I found that it was after by 20-25 nanosec
